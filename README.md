## Hi there 👋

I'm a junior undergraduate student majoring in Information Management and Information Systems at Tianjin University. Currently, I'm working as a research assistant at the TJU RL-lab.

### 🔬 Research Interests
- **Agent Memory**: Exploring memory mechanisms for intelligent agents
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Studying coordination and cooperation strategies among multiple agents

### 🌱 Currently Learning
I'm actively learning from these excellent resources:
- [动手学强化学习 (Hands-on Reinforcement Learning)](https://github.com/junnannie/RL) - Reinforcement learning algorithms and implementations
- [动手学深度学习 (Dive into Deep Learning)](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-zh) - Deep learning fundamentals and practices
- [CS329S: ML Deployment Tutorial](https://github.com/mrdbourke/cs329s-ml-deployment-tutorial) - Machine learning deployment strategies
- [Hands-on Machine Learning](https://github.com/ForceInjection/hands-on-ML) - Practical ML implementations
- [Stanford CS336: Foundation Models](https://github.com/stanford-cs336) - Foundation models and large language models

### 💭 About Me
> "I'm not particularly good at math, English, or programming, but I just love learning."

I believe that passion and continuous learning are more important than initial proficiency. Every day is an opportunity to grow and improve! 🚀
